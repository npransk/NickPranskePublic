## Sharpness-Aware Minimization Project

This project was done in a Machine Learning class under Dr. Sophie Zhai (https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=cbeK_4QAAAAJ&hl=en). The basis of the project was to understand and implement Sharpness-Aware Minimization to a generalized model. In this repository, you can find our the original paper and code (code modified by me) along with our final report and presentation. Enjoy!
