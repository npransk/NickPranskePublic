    "The University of Oklahoma (OU) is a public research university in Norman, Oklahoma. Founded in 1890, it had existed in Oklahoma Territory near Indian Territory for 17 years before the two territories became the state of Oklahoma. In Fall 2022, the university had 28,840 students enrolled,[7] most at its main campus in Norman. Employing nearly 3,000 faculty members,[3] the university offers 152 baccalaureate programs, 160 master's programs, 75 doctorate programs, and 20 majors at the first professional level.[8]\n",
    "\n",
    "The university is classified among \"R1: Doctoral Universities â€“ Very high research activity\".[9] Its Norman campus has two prominent museums, the Fred Jones Jr. Museum of Art, specializing in French Impressionism and Native American artwork, and the Sam Noble Oklahoma Museum of Natural History, specializing in the natural history of Oklahoma.\n",
    "\n",
    "The University of Oklahoma has won 34 NCAA national championships, ranking the Sooners 13th all-time in NCAA team titles. The women's softball team has won the national championship six times: in 2000, 2013, and consecutively in 2016 and 2017 and in 2021 and 2022. The gymnastics teams have won a combined 11 national championships since 2002, with the men's team winning eight in the last 15 years, including three consecutive titles from 2015 to 2017.[10]\n",
    "\n",
    "With the support of Governor George Washington Steele, on December 18, 1890, the Oklahoma Territorial legislature established three universities: the state university in Norman, the agricultural and mechanical college in Stillwater (later renamed Oklahoma State University) and a normal school in Edmond (later renamed University of Central Oklahoma).[11] Oklahoma's admission into the union in 1907 led to the renaming of the Norman Territorial University as the University of Oklahoma. Norman residents donated 407 acres (1.6 km2) of land for the university 0.5 miles (0.8 km) south of the Norman railroad depot. The university's first president ordered the planting of trees before the construction of the first campus building because he \"could not visualize a treeless university seat.\"[12] Landscaping remains important to the university.[13]\n",
    "\n",
    "The university's first president, David Ross Boyd, arrived in Norman in August 1892, and the first students enrolled that year. The university established a School of Pharmacy in 1893 because of the territory's high demand for pharmacists. Three years later, the university awarded its first degree to a pharmaceutical chemist.[14] The \"Rock Building\" in downtown Norman held the initial classes until the university's first building opened on September 6, 1893.[15]\n",
    "\n",
    "On January 6, 1903, the university's only building burned down and destroyed many records of the early university. Construction began immediately on a new building, as several other towns hoped to convince the university to move. President Boyd and the faculty were not dismayed by the loss. Mathematics professor Frederick Elder said, \"What do you need to keep classes going? Two yards of blackboard and a box of chalk.\"[16] As a response to the fire, English professor Vernon Louis Parrington created a plan for the development of the campus. Although much of the plan was never implemented, Parrington's suggestion for the campus core formed the basis for the North Oval. The North and South Ovals are now distinctive features of the campus.\n",
    "\n",
    "The campus has a distinctive architecture, with buildings designed in a unique \"Cherokee Gothic\" style. The style has many features of the Gothic era but has also mixed the designs of local Native American tribes from Oklahoma. This term was coined by the renowned American architect Frank Lloyd Wright when he visited the campus.[17] The university has built over a dozen buildings in the Cherokee Gothic style.\n",
